**Subject:** Catering Website Proposal

Hi [Mom + Friend],

I've looked at what you need for the catering site, and here's what I can offer:

**Option A — Basic Site (Family Discount, $2,000)**
- 5 pages: Home, About, Menu/Services, Gallery, Contact
- One contact form routed to email
- Template-based design (no custom CMS)
- Optimized images (client-provided)
- 1 hr training + quick written guide
- 14 days of bug fixes after launch

**Option B — Professional Site (Recommended, $3,500)**
- Custom layout & CMS (so you can easily update menus and gallery)
- Multi-field catering request form (saved or emailed)
- Optimized gallery with food/service images
- Cloudflare hosting, analytics, email routing setup
- 2 hrs training + recorded walkthrough & docs
- 30 days support + 2 rounds of revisions

**Option C — Turnkey Premium ($5,000+)**
- Everything in B, plus: booking/quote engine, advanced forms, professional food photography coordination, SEO basics, 3 months included support

**Terms:**
- 50% deposit to start, balance on launch
- Two revision rounds included; extra billed hourly
- Out-of-scope work (extra pages, advanced booking, SEO campaigns, etc.) billed at $75/hr

I'm happy to do Option A as a family discount, but Option B is what I recommend for something maintainable and professional.

Let me know which package you'd like to move forward with.
