# Website Project Assets & Templates

This document collects the assistant outputs from our conversation that are useful to save as reference files: the pitch email, contract skeleton, line-item quote breakdown, intake questionnaire (plain + Google Form fields), v0 AI prompts, and the starter portfolio `index.html` (separate file already created). Use this as your single reference when talking to clients or generating the site with AI.

- 5 pages: Home, About, Menu/Services, Gallery, Contact
- One contact form routed to email
- Template-based design (no custom CMS)
- Optimized images (client-provided)
- 1 hr training + quick written guide
- 14 days of bug fixes after launch

**Option B — Professional Site (Recommended, $3,500)**
- Custom layout & CMS (so you can easily update menus and gallery)
- Multi-field catering request form (saved or emailed)
- Optimized gallery with food/service images
- Cloudflare hosting, analytics, email routing setup
- 2 hrs training + recorded walkthrough & docs
- 30 days support + 2 rounds of revisions

**Option C — Turnkey Premium ($5,000+)**
- Everything in B, plus: booking/quote engine, advanced forms, professional food photography coordination, SEO basics, 3 months included support

**Terms:**
- 50% deposit to start, balance on launch
- Two revision rounds included; extra billed hourly

- If you want, I can:
  - Generate a README with GitHub Pages deploy commands,
  - Export this document as a downloadable file (PDF/MD), or
  - Create the Notion workspace structure for project management.
