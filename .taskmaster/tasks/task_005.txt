**COLLABORATIVE THEME DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**

Instead of implementing a pre-defined cyberpunk/space theme, we'll work together to create and refine the design through iterative collaboration. This ensures the final theme truly represents reishi's unique vision and personality.

**Process:**
1. Start with basic HTML structure and current content
2. Collaborate on color palette and visual elements
3. Iteratively refine the design together
4. Test and adjust based on feedback
5. Finalize theme that feels authentic to reishi's brand

**Benefits:**
- More personalized and authentic design
- Real-time feedback and adjustments
- Better alignment with reishi's vision
- Collaborative creative process
