# Website Project Intake Prompt (v0) â€” Plain Questionnaire

**General Business Info**
1. What's the exact business name and tagline (if any)?
2. Do you already have a logo, fonts, and color palette? If not, should I create a simple brand style or just pick clean defaults?
3. Who is your target audience (weddings, corporate events, families, etc.)?

**Content & Images**
4. Do you have final written content (About text, Menu descriptions, Service list), or should I draft placeholders for you to edit?
5. Will you provide photos of your food/services, or should I source high-quality stock images?
6. Do you want a gallery page (grid of food pics), or should images just appear within service pages?

**Forms / Questionnaires**
7. What information should the contact form collect (name, phone, email, message)?
8. Do you want a catering request/quote form? If yes:
   - What fields should it include (event date, # of guests, type of service, budget, etc.)?
   - Should submissions just email you, or also be saved to a database/spreadsheet?

**Hosting, Email, and Tools**
9. Do you want me to set up business email (e.g., yourname@catering.com) via Google Workspace, or will you stick with existing emails?
10. Do you need analytics (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.)?

**Website Management**
11. Who will be responsible for updating the website after launch?
12. Would you prefer:
   - A template site (limited but easier), or
   - A CMS (slightly more complex but allows updates to menus/gallery without code)?

**Training & Handoff**
13. How many people need training?
14. Do you want me to record a walkthrough video for future reference?

**Support & Maintenance**
15. After launch, do you want:
   - One-time delivery with a short support window (included in package), or
   - An ongoing support plan (monthly retainer or hourly)?

**Note:** Any extra requests outside the selected package (new pages, booking engine, SEO campaigns, etc.) will be quoted separately.
